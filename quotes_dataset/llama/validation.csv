1119,"inspiration: Personally, I can't see the appeal in trekking down to D.C. for a networking extravaganza, even if it is built around a special moment in American history. While I find the election of Barack Obama inspirational, I don't have a desire to memorialize it with overly effusive celebration."
1120,"love: I realized how truly hard it was, really, to see someone you love change right before your eyes. Not only is it scary, it throws your balance off as well."

I'm your High Priestess and you've pledged yourself to me. That means you have my heart, too.""""Then both of us better stay safe. A heart's a hard thing to live without. I should know. I've tried it."
1143,"purpose: It's funny. No matter how hard you try, you can't close your heart forever. And the minute you open it up, you never know what's going to come in. But when it does, you just have to go for it! Because if you don't, there's not point in being here."

2386,"science: The true men of action in our time those who transform the world are not the politicians and statesmen but the scientists. Unfortunately poetry cannot celebrate them because their deeds are concerned with things, not persons, and are therefore speechless.

2393,"god: The glory of God is the living man, but the life of man is the vision of God', says St. Irenaeus, getting to the heart of what happens when man meets God on the mountain in the wilderness. Ultimately, it is the very life of man, man himself as living righteously, that is the true worship of God, but life only becomes real life when it receives its form from looking toward God."

2407,"love: We could do it, you know.""""What?""""Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we could make it."
2408,"philosophy: What we have forgotten is that thoughts and words are conventions, and that it is fatal to take conventions too seriously. A convention is a social convenience, as, for example, money ... but it is absurd to take money too seriously, to confuse it with real wealth ... In somewhat the same way, thoughts, ideas and words are ""coins""for real things."

2416,"life: Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come."
2417,"humor: To me, Ann Romney sounds like a better candidate than her husband. She put her MS into remission through horseback riding, alternative therapies, and a healthy diet.

2427,inspiration: You is kind. You is smart. You is important.
2428,"books: People don't read any more. It's a sad state of affairs. Reading's the only thing that allows you to use your imagination. When you watch films it's someone else's vision, isn't it?""[Interview in The Independent, 15 October 2005]"
2429,"books: When writers die they become books, which is, after all, not too bad an incarnation.""[As attributed by Alastair Reid in Neruda and Borges, The New Yorker, June 24, 1996; as well as in The Talk of the Town, The New Yorker, July 7, 1986]"

2438,"inspiration: Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required."
2439,"philosophy: A Paradox, the doughnut hole. Empty space, once, but now they've learned to market even that. A minus quantity; nothing, rendered edible. I wondered if they might be used-metaphorically, of course-to demonstrate the existence of God. Does naming a sphere of nothingness transmute it into being?"

2452,religion: Science and religion are not at odds. Science is simply too young to understand.
2453,"death: Because God is never cruel, there is a reason for all things. We must know the pain of loss; because if we never knew it, we would have no compassion for others, and we would become monsters of self-regard, creatures of unalloyed self-interest. The terrible pain of loss teaches humility to our prideful kind, has the power to soften uncaring hearts, to make a better person of a good one."

2490,relationship: A dame that knows the ropes isn't likely to get tied up.
2491,"love: It takes courage to love, but pain through love is the purifying fire which those who love generously know.

2937,"life: God surely did not create us, and cause us to live, with the sole end of wishing always to die. I believe, in my heart, we were intended to prize life and enjoy it, so long as we retain it. Existence never was originally meant to be that useless, blank, pale, slow-trailing thing it often becomes to many, and is becoming to me, among the rest."

5817,"success: I haven't deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies. In fact, it's probably been quite the opposite.

This much, at least, I've figured out. I know this much is true."

5856,"friendship: The beginning of a friendship, the fact that two people out of the thousands around them can meet and connect and become friends, seems like a kind of magic to me. But maintaining a friendship requires work. I don't mean that as a bad thing. Good art requires work as well."

5887,"education: What do teachers and curriculum directors mean by 'value' reading?

6324,writing: The writer walks out of his workroom in a daze. He wants a drink. He needs it. It happens to be a fact that nearly every writer of fiction in the world drinks more whisky than is good for him. He does it to give himself faith hope and courage. A person is a fool to become a writer. His only compensation is absolute freedom. He has no master except his own soul and that I am sure is why he does it.
6325,"relationship: I don't understand dating.. and the other things that people do.. all I know is that you ought to find the one you recognize.

6342,"arts: I collect art, and I drink wine... things that I like that I had never been exposed to. But I never said, 'I'm going to buy art to impress this crowd.' That's just ridiculous to me. I don't live my life like that, because how could you be happy with yourself?"

6421,humor: A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that's just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it's a joke.

6444,humor: You have to have a sense of humor about life to get through it.
6445,"life: Just because life is hard, and always ends in a bad way, doesn't mean that all stories have to, even if that's what they tell us in school and in the New York Times Review. In fact, it's a good thing that stories are as different as we are, one from another."

6456,education: The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers.
6457,"love: The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be.

Such is our anguish of thirst!"

6884,life: To live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else.
6885,"knowledge: Without knowledge of what I am and why I am here, it is impossible to live, and since I cannot know that, I cannot live either.

6902,"religion: I don't know how you feel, but I'm pretty sick of church people. You know what they ought to do with churches? Tax them. If holy people are so interested in politics, government, and public policy, let them pay the price of admission like everybody else. The Catholic Church alone could wipe out the national debt if all you did was tax their real estate."

6932,"love: Do you know what hurts so very much? It's love. Love is the strongest force in the world, and when it is blocked that means pain. There are two things we can do when this happens. We can kill that love so that it stops hurting. But then of course part of us dies, too. Or we can ask God to open up another route for that love to travel."

6965,"philosophy: *""Maybe the whole point of my life is to make you feel more alive."
6966,"god: Do you really mean to tell me the only reason you try to be good is to gain God's approval and reward, or to avoid his disapproval and punishment?

7199,religion: Theology is the effort to explain the unknowable in terms of the not worth knowing.
7200,"philosophy: Unfortunately, religion often works to shrink and tame the very wild and mysterious forces that first drew our wonder.

7249,"love: Love is a decision, it is a judgment, it is a promise. If love were only a feeling, there would be no basis for the promise to love each other forever. A feeling comes and it may go. How can I judge that it will stay forever, when my act does not involve judgment and decision."
